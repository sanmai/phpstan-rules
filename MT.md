# Mutation Testing Insights

This document captures key insights gained from applying mutation testing to improve this codebase.

## Core Principle: Listen to the Mutations

**Mutations reveal redundant branches that should be eliminated, not tested.**

When mutation testing shows that removing code doesn't change behavior (escaped mutants), it's often telling us that the code itself is unnecessary complexity that can be removed.

## Insights from Our Journey

### 1. Redundant Type Guards

**Pattern**: Early return guards that check types when the type is already constrained by PHPStan.

**Example**:
```php
// BEFORE: Redundant guard
public function processNode(Node $node, Scope $scope): array
{
    if (!$this->isLoopNode($node)) {
        return [];
    }
    // ...
}

// AFTER: Optimize node type declaration
public function getNodeType(): string
{
    return Stmt::class; // More specific than Node::class
}
```

**Insight**: When a rule can declare a more specific node type, do so. This eliminates the need for runtime type checking.

### 2. Dead Code Branches

**Pattern**: Conditional logic that doesn't affect outcomes.

**Example**:
```php
// BEFORE: Redundant Nop handling
if ($statement instanceof Stmt\Nop) {
    return true; // or continue - doesn't matter!
}

// AFTER: Remove entire branch
// (Nop handling was unnecessary)
```

**Insight**: If changing `return true` to `continue` to `break` doesn't break tests, the entire branch is likely dead code.

### 3. Overly Complex Guards

**Pattern**: Multi-step validation that can be simplified.

**Example**:
```php
// BEFORE: Verbose guards
private function isCountCall(Node $node): bool
{
    if (!$node instanceof FuncCall) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!$node->name instanceof Name) {
        return false;
    }
    return 'count' === strtolower($node->name->toString());
}

// AFTER: Single expression
private function isCountCall(Node $node): bool
{
    return $node instanceof FuncCall 
        && $node->name instanceof Name
        && 'count' === strtolower($node->name->toString());
}
```

**Insight**: Sequential guards can often be combined into clearer single expressions.

### 4. Policy Constraints vs Technical Requirements

**Pattern**: Some escaped mutants represent business logic, not technical requirements.

**Example**:
```php
// This constraint is a POLICY DECISION:
if (1 !== count($statements)) {
    return []; // Only flag single-statement ifs
}
```

**Insight**: Not all escaped mutants should be eliminated. Some represent intentional policy decisions that should be:
1. Recognized as such
2. Documented with tests
3. Consciously preserved

### 5. Expanding vs Restricting Rules

**Pattern**: Mutations can reveal overly restrictive rules that could be more comprehensive.

**Example**:
```php
// RESTRICTIVE: Only handles Expression-wrapped yields
if (!$statement instanceof Expression) {
    return false;
}

// COMPREHENSIVE: Handles both direct and wrapped yields
if ($statement instanceof Yield_ || $statement instanceof YieldFrom) {
    return true;
}
if ($statement instanceof Expression) {
    return $statement->expr instanceof Yield_ || $statement->expr instanceof YieldFrom;
}
```

**Insight**: When mutations reveal constraints, consider if relaxing them makes the rule more useful.

## Key Metrics Achieved

- **Initial State**: 88% MSI with 8 escaped mutants
- **After Simplification**: 89% MSI with 3 escaped mutants  
- **After Policy Tests**: 97% covered MSI
- **Code Removed**: ~20 lines of redundant complexity
- **Code Quality**: Simpler, more maintainable

## Practical Workflow

1. **Run mutation testing** to identify escaped mutants
2. **Analyze each mutant** - Is this redundant code or a policy constraint?
3. **For redundant code**: Remove it entirely
4. **For policy constraints**: Write tests that validate the constraint
5. **Question constraints**: Could the rule be more useful without this restriction?
6. **Simplify aggressively**: Combine guards, use specific types, eliminate dead branches

## When to Stop

Perfect mutation coverage (100%) isn't always the goal. Stop when:

1. Remaining mutants represent clear policy decisions
2. The code is as simple as it can be
3. Adding more tests would test the tests, not the code
4. Further changes would reduce code clarity

## The Ultimate Test

**If removing code doesn't break tests, the code shouldn't exist.**

This principle guides us toward simpler, more maintainable systems where every line of code has a purpose.
